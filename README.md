My another attempt to build an app utilizing clean architecture approaches and modern tools.

# Post Checkout

Please note that CocoaPods are not checked in into the repository, so after checkout they need to be installed via the two following commands:

1. Install the compatible version of the *pod* tool into the source tree:

        bundle install

2. Install the compatible version of the pods using just installed pod tool:

        bundle exec pod install
